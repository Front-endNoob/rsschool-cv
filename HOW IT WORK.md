## **You can also download this repository and follow the next steps to create an Electron application for your PC or Notebook:**
  1) Go to the section: **/simple-desktop-app-electronjs**
  2) Open **command line** or **terminal**
  3) Enter: **nmp install**
  4) When the necessary dependencies are downloaded, you can pack or make an application installation file for your platform:
     4.1) Enter command: **npm run make** - for to attempt to automatically detect your platform and create an installation file.
     4.2) Enter command: **npm run package** - for to try to automatically detect your platform and create an immediately deployed package
          of files in place with the application launch file
## 5) To manually specify the platform and its architecture, you can use a command of the form: --platform=<platform> --arch=<arch>
   5.1) Example: With this code, we will pack an application for Linux with a 64-bit architecture npm run package --platform=linux --arch=x64
   5.2) You can just specify the platform and that will be enough. Example: npm run package --platform=darwin and such a code command will package applications for the Mac OS system
